    "In this notebook, we explored two approaches—fuzzy string matching and TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity—to resolve new queries against a set of resolved queries. By combining the strengths of both methods, we improved the accuracy of query resolution. This approach can be further enhanced by tuning thresholds or incorporating more advanced NLP techniques for even better results."
